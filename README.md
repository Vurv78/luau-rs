# üåî ``luau-rs``
> [Luau](https://github.com/Roblox/luau) bindings for the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language using [bindgen](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-bindgen)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WIP ‚ö†Ô∏è
Currently this **DOES NOT** compile because of issues with the compiler & ast w/ bindgen. Need a manual fix for this.

## Usage
Add this to your ``Cargo.toml``
```toml
[dependencies]
luau = { git = "https://github.com/Vurv78/luau-rs" }
```

## Requirements
See the requirements for bindgen [here](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html)
